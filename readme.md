Welcome to Ironclad Server, your personal playground for testing and improving your hacking skills while learning about [Application Security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_security). 

If you work or are interested in the field of Cyber Security or Ethical Hacking, chances are that you know a lot of websites that allow you to develop your hacking skills. At some point, you may ask yourself... how could I actually change the server's source code and turn it **unhackable**? :superhero_woman:

## About

IroncladServer is a web server designed with the purpose of providing a safe and legal environment for ethical hackers, cybersecurity enthusiasts, and developers to test their skills and learn about AppSec. 

In its first release, the server features text input fields where users can input a username and password. 

The challenge? **Try to break in! Hack it away with your dodgy, dark-webby tools!**  :space_invader: 

Our ultimate goal is to provide a robust, secure template that developers can use for their own projects, while simultaneously educating users about the importance of application security.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Test your skills against our secure login system.
- **Real-World Scenarios**: The server is designed to mimic real-world systems, providing practical experience.
- **Educational Resource**: Learn about application security in a hands-on, interactive way.

## Future Goals

We envision IroncladServer as a platform for educating people about application security. In the future, we plan to expand the server's capabilities and provide more resources for learning and experimentation.
